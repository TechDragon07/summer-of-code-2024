i learned a lot while implementing this and realised that the copy was getting a bit too messy so i decide to start a new one for further models.

i tried to make things clear and work concisely. i could not perform the timeseriessplit here as it kept crashing 1-3hrs in.

i was able to analyse prophet model completely but could not get mape scores because they were too small. while analysing lstm using timeseriessplit, i experienced some connectivity issues which led to the computation stopping 3+hrs in (i was using local runtime) so i could not get final mean scores.

overall, a lot of things went wrong while doing this week's tasks but i learned a lot.
